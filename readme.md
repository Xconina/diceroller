I have two different dice roller programs made in Python.
They both work similarly. Both of them will have a GUI made with Tkinter pop up when you run the program. 
There, you will select a die to roll. There are different options depending on how many sides of dice you want. 
You will click a button to decide which dice to roll.

On diceroll.py, the terminal will say 'Now rolling' and after a time delay, it will output your result.
on diceroller2.py, the output will pop up next to the button you clicked after 0.5 seconds.
